# ExpOS Bootstrap

This repository contains a shell script to download the latest versions of the
components used in ExpOS development. 

A Makefile is also provided to compile them all in one go.

# Instructions

Copy the following snippet to your terminal and press enter.

```bash
curl -sSf https://github.com/eXpOSNitc/expos-bootstrap/raw/main/download.sh | sh
```

This should download all the necessary components ready for compiling.

Then you can run `make` to compile them.
